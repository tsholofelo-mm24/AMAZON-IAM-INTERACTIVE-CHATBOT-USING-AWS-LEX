# Technical Approach:

* The Structure of the Quiz is built for the Learners to use only the Text Technique. The first thing they will do is When they start the Quiz, they type a message greeting for **Example(Hello, Hi, Hey, Quiz Me)** which is an **Utterance** we give learners a cool Welcome, then the quiz begins.
* An **Intent** was added to name the Quiz. In the Intent we added **Slot Types**. One for the Question Field where the learner chooses their answer from Four **opions(A,B,C or D)**.
* Another **Slot Type** was added to prompt the learner to if they want to continue to the next Question they select **option(Yes or No)**.
* **Conditional Branching** was used to Validate if the Learner has selected the **Correct or Incorrect Answer**. The Response Message will show. After the message, Depending on the selection option. It will either asks if the learner wants to **Proceed**, **move to the next Question**, or **Close the Quiz**.









Our goal to our clients is that we Strive to prepare them for a _Technologically Advanced Future_ by Equipping them with _In-Demand Digital Skills_ and _Fostering Collaboration and Accessibility_ in Learning.
